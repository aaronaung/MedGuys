# MedGuys
Apply machine learning on opensource health data to predict the mortality rate of a selected health disease

##Inspiration
To spread awareness of the mortality rates regarding various diseases including cancer and strokes.

##What it does
Displays graphs and reports prediction data.

##How we built it
We used a chart library to create graphs that represent the mortality rate of the diseases, and machine learning libraries to provide prediction data for each disease. (Extensive use of HTML, CSS, and jQuery for user friendly interface)

##Challenges we ran into
Searching for a data source relevant to disease mortality.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working collectively, designing a clear and interactive UI, training our machine learning models

##What we learned
One person can't do everything; Time management; Working to each member's strength and skill-set.

##What's next for MedGuys
Integrating live health data Adding more graphs for different types of data visualization
