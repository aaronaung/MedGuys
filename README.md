# MedGuys www.medguys.tech
Apply machine learning on opensource health data to predict the mortality rate of a selected health disease

<h4>Inspiration</h4>
To spread awareness of the mortality rates regarding various diseases including cancer and strokes.

<h4>What it does</h4>
Displays graphs and reports prediction data.

<h4>How we built it</h4>
We used a chart library to create graphs that represent the mortality rate of the diseases, and machine learning libraries to provide prediction data for each disease. (Extensive use of HTML, CSS, and jQuery for user friendly interface)

<h4>Challenges we ran into</h4>
Searching for a data source relevant to disease mortality.

<h4>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h4>
Working collectively, designing a clear and interactive UI, training our machine learning models

<h4>What we learned</h4>
One person can't do everything; Time management; Working to each member's strength and skill-set.

<h4>What's next for MedGuys</h4>
Integrating live health data Adding more graphs for different types of data visualization
